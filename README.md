We see most of the student are confused on where to study after see, how to choose a suitable college for us based on out interest, financial conditions, and many more.

<b>You may ask why this project? We already have sites like edusanjal, collegenp, collegesnepal etc.</b>
--------lets call these sites <strong>Edu sites</strong>---------

As you know we find bunch of colleges list in those <strong>Edu sites</strong>. So the students will get confused seeing the best of best colleges on the site. 

So We have brought this product prototype. Our theme is to help students to shortlist colleges for them based on their needs. 

<b>We can take an example:</b>
Rachel is a recent SEE passed student. He is looking for good college to study 10+2. So he visited edusanjal website and came to see bunch of colleges over there.
He gets puzzeled and ask his brother who has been doing masters degree. He suggested Rachel to study ABC, XYZ or MNO college.
Rachel is now happy because his brother shortlisted colleges for him. Now he can go through those colleges on <strong>Edu sites</strong> and apply for them.



So, we are trying to become the brother who helped Rachel shortlist college for him.
