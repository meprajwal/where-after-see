We see most of the student are confused on where to study after see, how to choose a suitable college for us based on out interest, financial conditions, and many more.

<b>You may ask why this project? We already have sites like edusanjal, collegenp, collegesnepal etc.</b>
<br>
--------lets call these sites <strong>Edu sites</strong>---------
<br>

As you know we find bunch of colleges list in those <strong>Edu sites</strong>. So the students will get confused seeing the best of best colleges on the site. 
<br>

So We have brought this product prototype. Our theme is to help students to shortlist colleges for them based on their needs. 
<br>

<b>We can take an example:</b>
<br>
Rachel is a recent SEE passed student. He is looking for good college to study 10+2. So he visited edusanjal website and came to see bunch of colleges over there.<br>
He gets puzzeled and ask his brother who has been doing masters degree. He suggested Rachel to study ABC, XYZ or MNO college.<br>
Rachel is now happy because his brother shortlisted colleges for him. Now he can go through those colleges on <strong>Edu sites</strong> and apply for them.
<br> <br>


So, we are trying to become the brother who helped Rachel shortlist college for him.
